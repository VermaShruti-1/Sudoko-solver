Sudoku is a combinatorial number placement puzzle with 9 x 9 cell grid partially filled in with numbers from 1 to 9. The goal is to fill remaining, blank fields with the rest of numbers so that each row and column will have only one number of each kind.
// Pseudocode for Sudoku Solver
// 1. Define a 9x9 board to represent the Sudoku grid.
// 2. Implement the solveSudoku method using recursive backtracking:
//    a. Iterate over each cell of the board.
//    b. If a cell is empty (value 0):
//       i. Try placing numbers 1 through 9 in the cell.
//       ii. Check if the placement is valid using the isValidPlacement method.
//       iii. If valid, place the number and recursively call solveSudoku.
//       iv. If the recursive call fails, backtrack by resetting the cell to 0.
//    c. If no empty cells remain, the puzzle is solved.
// 3. Implement the isValidPlacement method:
//    a. Check the row, column, and 3x3 subgrid to ensure the number is not repeated.
// 4. Print the solved board if a solution exists; otherwise, indicate no solution.

How It Works
solveSudoku():

Iterates through the Sudoku board.
If an empty cell is found, it tries numbers 1 through 9.
Checks if a number is valid using the isValidPlacement() method.
If the number is valid, it places it and recursively solves the rest of the board.
If placing a number leads to no solution, it backtracks and tries the next number.
isValidPlacement():

Ensures that the number doesn't already exist in the current row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.
printBoard():

Prints the solved Sudoku board.
